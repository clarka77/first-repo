1. Look at what brands they sell
2. Find the top seller items for that brand line, in Amazon (use Jungle Scout or whatever)
3. See if the top 5 items from that brand line are any good in terms of profit
4. If not, move on to the next brand. You may miss some opportunities, but you save a lot of time digging with scrappers and all that sh...it
5. In other words: I just analyze the top sellers before anything, and not bother checking all items in a brand one by one.

Adrian Barbu Means that you need a lot of suppliers, but you get only best deals out of them. Not bad approach at all. Less sourcing, more supplier finding, faster sellers in your portfolio. üëç

Not creating new listings at all.

Majority of Amazon products listings on which we do sell are bundles and multipacks

one full time working person should be able to get through 100K product lines pricelist in one month, if not faster.  And believe me, this way you will find 10+ times more profitable products and those which are not picked by software will be your gold nugget lines with small or no competition at all.
